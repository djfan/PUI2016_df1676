![Electricity Meter Data for January 2012](/Users/Alan/Documents/CUSP 5003 PUI/PUI2016_df1676/HW8_df1676/Electricity Meter Data for January 2012.png)

The plot is made by Xinshi Zheng with clear title, x&y labels and legend. It shows the trends of Electricity Meter Data in different time periods of different days in January, 2012. If Xinshi can enlarge the fontsize of title, x&y labe and legend as well as change the legend to 2 or 3-column style, the plot would be better to read.

For the content, because there are 31 lines in this plot, some colors that represente different lines are quite similar (like Jan 5th and Jan 12th), making it hard to tell specific target lines. Besides, lines are quite overlapped which makes the plot a little messy. In order to make this plot clearly understood, Xinshi can display data by week, not by day, which x label are "Mon 0:30, Mon5:30,…,Fri 15:30, Fri 20:30". Also, he can use 3D plot in which x axis and y axis represente "Time" and "Date" respectively. 

Since I don't know the problem Xinshi researches on and what conclusions he want to draw from this plot, my suggestions above are only for reference. And he's suppoesd to write down some notes to explain why he made this plot.
